            <h1>Policies Page</h1>
            <h3><strong>First Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>Under consumer protection legislation including the Australian Consumer Law contained in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), we give certain non-excludable guarantees in respect of goods and services we supply to you and you have certain non-excludable rights if those guarantees are not met, which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions is intended to exclude, restrict or modify your non-excludable rights. The limitations on and exclusions of our liability contained in these Terms and Conditions apply only to the full extent permitted by law.</p>
            <h3><strong>Second Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>Even though anyone can visit our website, product (s) can only be purchased by end users and/or consumers aged 18 or over, or when you have permission from your parent or legal guardian.</p>
            <h3><strong>Third Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>We are entitled to refuse or cancel your order. However, we must have a justified reason for doing so.</p>
            <h3><strong>Fourth Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>The prices on our website are consumer prices, in AUD and include GST but exclude delivery costs. The prices only apply to purchases via our website and may differ from the prices that are used for the same product (s) in a TipToe Soles store.

            Not all product (s) and offers that are offered on our website are available in TipToe Soles stores and vice versa.</p>
            <h3><strong>Fifth Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>We deliver the order at the address that has been given by you when placing your order. Where we are unable to deliver to your address, we may deliver your parcel to a local pick up point as indicated on your attempted delivery card. The times of delivery mentioned by us are only indications and are not guaranteed. The latest time of delivery is 30 days after the date the order is placed. We try to inform you about any delays, in so far as possible. In so far as permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages as a result of late delivery.</p>
